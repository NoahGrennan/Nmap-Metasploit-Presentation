# Nmap-Metasploit-Presentation
Powerpoint and demo on the cybersecuiotry tools such as nmap and Metasploit.

Using nmap, we can find open ports on a network
ex. nmap -sV [ip-address]
Using Metasploit we can use those open ports and find exploits into them.
ex msfconsole -> search [port] -> use [#] ->set RHOSTS and LHOST -> run
